In week 2 homework, we were required to make a site from scratch, resembeling a porfolio where my project is linked to the GitHub repository. HTML and CSS is used for this homework. The homework had certain acceptance criteria that was required to be met. 

## What was done?

HTML and CSS written completly from scratch by me. Most of time in this homework was spent on CSS coding. Designing the site and aligning properties, so the site is usable and pleasent to the eye.
